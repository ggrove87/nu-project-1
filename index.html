                    <h3>Story</h3>
                    <h5 id="movieStory">
                        On the peaceful planet Druidia, King Roland attempts to
                        marry his daughter Princess Vespa to Prince Valium, but
                        Vespa and her loyal droid Dot Matrix escape during her
                        wedding. After wasting the fresh air on the distant planet
                        Spaceball, the good-for-nothing President Skroob orders the
                        archvillain henchman Dark Helmet to kidnap Princess Vespa to
                        force King Roland to provide them with the code to Druidia's
                        atmosphere. Under those circumstances, the seasoned
                        mercenary Lone Starr and his trusty half-human, half-canine
                        sidekick Barf will attempt to save the Princess in distress,
                        while at the same time, the ruthless loan-shark Pizza the
                        Hutt is after them. But in the end, only he who can harness
                        the mystical and mighty force known only as "The Schwartz"
                        will be able to save the day.â€”Nick Riganas

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <h5 id="movieTrivia">
                        The Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars saga makes a cameo
                        appearance in this movie. Take a close look at the exterior
                        shot of the Space Diner, and it can be spotted parked there
                        among the other space vehicles. George Lucas got a chance to
                        read the screenplay before production began, and loved it so
                        much that he decided to have his special effects company,
                        Industrial Light & Magic, help make this movie.
