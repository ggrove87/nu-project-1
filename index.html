                    On the peaceful planet Druidia, King Roland attempts to
                    marry his daughter Princess Vespa to Prince Valium, but
                    Vespa and her loyal droid Dot Matrix escape during her
                    wedding. After wasting the fresh air on the distant planet
                    Spaceball, the good-for-nothing President Skroob orders the
                    archvillain henchman Dark Helmet to kidnap Princess Vespa to
                    force King Roland to provide them with the code to Druidia's
                    atmosphere. Under those circumstances, the seasoned
                    mercenary Lone Starr and his trusty half-human, half-canine
                    sidekick Barf will attempt to save the Princess in distress,
                    while at the same time, the ruthless loan-shark Pizza the
                    Hutt is after them. But in the end, only he who can harness
                    the mystical and mighty force known only as "The Schwartz"
                    will be able to save the day.â€”Nick Riganas

                    The Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars saga makes a cameo
                    appearance in this movie. Take a close look at the exterior
                    shot of the Space Diner, and it can be spotted parked there
                    among the other space vehicles. George Lucas got a chance to
                    read the screenplay before production began, and loved it so
                    much that he decided to have his special effects company,
                    Industrial Light & Magic, help make this movie.
